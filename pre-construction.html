<p>Our Pre-construction Department of electrical engineers, detailers, estimators, and project managers helps save valuable time and money before the first conduit is placed.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/pre-construction.jpg" alt="Pre-construction" title="Pre-construction" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;" />The planning stages of a project are often the most important, and our pre-construction team is ready to partner with you to maximize value, identify and offset obstacles, and work with you to stay on time and on budget.</p>
<p>We listen to your needs and provide feedback on your design. We remain deeply involved in the scheduling and coordination of the labor throughout the construction document design.</p>
