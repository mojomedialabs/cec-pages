<p>A letter from our founder:</p>
<div class="letter">
	<p>CEC Electrical was founded in 2009 with the vision of becoming one of the most trusted subcontractors in Texas. In the past three years, we have done just that, establishing an energetic, winning culture that has allowed us to become one of the fastest growing electrical contractors in Texas, with offices in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin.</p>
	<p>The secret to our success has been surrounding ourselves with exceptional people, and through our growth we have continued to attract the best and brightest to support our operations. The diversity of our project experience showcases the wide range of capabilities our company and people bring from engineering, preconstruction, and construction backgrounds.</p>
	<p>The CEC promise to our clients is that we are &quot;Safe, Responsive, and Committed&quot; to delivering successful projects no matter the obstacles. At CEC, our motto is &quot;Always On&quot; and we are dedicated to always going the extra mile to achieve nothing less than success.</p>
	<p>Our team brings a results-oriented focus on getting the project completed while exceeding client expectations. As we continue to grow, we remain committed to our core principles. We hope you will consider us for your next project.</p>
