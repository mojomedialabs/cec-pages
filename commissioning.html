<h3>The Case for Building Commissioning</h3>
<p>According to a 2009 study conducted by Evan Mills of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and sponsored by the California Energy Commission, commissioning is &quot;arguably the single-most cost-effective strategy for reducing energy, costs and greenhouse-gas emissions in buildings today&quot;. The study found that new building commissioning typically reduces energy usage by 13%, pays for itself in 4.2 years (excluding non-energy savings) and generates a 23% cash-on-cash return on investment. Significant non-energy benefits substantially reduce this payback period to between 1 and 2 years and subsequently increase the return on investment. This has certainly been the experience of our firm and its clients.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensures fully-operational critical building systems</li>
	<li>Lowers operating &amp; maintenance expenses</li>
	<li>Provides better indoor air quality</li>
	<li>Lessens the risk of &quot;sick building&quot; syndrome</li>
	<li>Enhances environmental control</li>
	<li>Decreases occupant complaints and increases productivity</li>
	<li>Increases efficiency of system energy</li>
	<li>Reduces maintenance/troubleshooting issues</li>
	<li>Ensures well-trained facility staff</li>
	<li>Reduces life-cycle costs of the facility</li>
	<li>Provides benchmarks for future performance appraisals</li>
	<li>Improves return on investment to owner</li>
</ul>
